  <p>Watercolour paints are made up of coloured pigments suspended in a water-soluble vehicle. Combining the reflection of the white paper, and the translucent, delicate watercolour paints, creates an enchanting luminosity on the page. Watercolours are not easy to master, but with the right techniques and plenty of practice, they can be incredibly rewarding.

  <p>An important warning: Watercolor is a beautiful painting medium, but it is not well suited to painting on canvas. The water-based paint tends to form beads and dry irregularly on canvas, especially a primed canvas. While this could be fun to add effects to a mixed media painting, working in watercolor on canvas will likely be frustrating for creating a complete work of art. An absorbent watercolor paper is a far better choice.
    As such, it is important to know what types of paper to use in order to create the look you wish to achieve. 
   <br><br> Generally, watercolour papers are one of three different surface types; Hot Pressed (HP), Cold Pressed (NOT) and Rough.

   <p> <span style="border: 1px solid rgb(211, 18, 18)">Hot pressed</span> is the smoothest watercolour paper and is great for artists looking to render their subjects in fine detail. This paper is popular with illustrators and designers as it gives a flat finish good for reproduction. 
    <span style="border: 1px solid rgb(211, 18, 18)">Cold Pressed</span> paper has a medium textured surface favoured by beginners as it is compatible with a variety of techniques and applications. 
    <span style="border: 1px solid rgb(211, 18, 18)">Rough</span>, as suggested by the name, is the most textured watercolour paper. The deep pits in the paper are brilliant if you want to get the most out of the granulation of your watercolour paints. This heavily textured paper is well suited to those with a loose watercolour painting style.
