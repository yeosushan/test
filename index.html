      <p>Over the month of April 2020, Singapore entered its circuit breaker period where everyone was not allowed to leave their homes. During this time, many people picked up new skills and hobbies. Some started baking, others began drawing. For me, I found a new hobby - painting! 
      </p>

      <i><h3 style="font-family:Monaco">Why painting?</h3></i>
      <p>I had always been intrigued by paintings, often visiting art museums in Singapore and overseas. This love for painting is clearly shared across the globe as there are many famous paintings which people travel across the world to see, such as the Mona Lisa! Below are a few of my favourite paintings that I have seen during my travels.

      <p>Painting is incredibly fun and also relaxing. You don’t need any formal training to begin, all you need is some paint, a few brushes and a canvas! Painting allows for you to unleash your creativity and express the complex emotions you feel. During the tough period of Circuit Breaker, painting provided me with solace and also a way to explore the outside world through paint rather than my physical self. I hope I can also inspire you to pick up a brush and step into the wonderful world of painting!

        <tr>
        <td>Features</td>
        <td>Acrylic is somewhere in between watercolour and oil.
          Depending on the technique used by the artist,  artist acrylic paints can look very much like oil or watercolor, and the meshing of the two lends to a style that is uniquely its own.</td>
        <td>Watercolour produces a more muted, somewhat clouded image. 
          It provides a more softened look and the subject can look runny or malleable.
          </td>
        <td>Oil paintings are very rich and vibrant. Oil can produce a sharper image and it is also good for colorful pieces that feature a layering of paint.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Pros</td>
        <td>Acrylic is the happy hybrid of the bunch. Like oil, it is well-suited for detail, but it is also easy to use. Artists have classified it as the most “forgiving” of the paints and best for novices. Acrylics are also water-based which means they can be cleaned from brushes more easily.</td>
        <td>Generally the least expensive of the three paints, watercolor makes it easier to paint large areas, or spaces that do not need to be completely filled in (like a painted face on a white background). A small tube of watercolor, mixed with water, can provide yards and yards of coverage. Watercolor offers nice color saturation, and dries pretty quickly.</td>
        <td>Oil paints are associated with permanence. They are best to use for demonstrating great detail and the contrast between light and dark. Light refracts through layers of oil paint, creating a luminous appearance of depth. Oil paints are durable and will stay solid over time — many famous masterpieces dating from the Renaissance onward are painted in oils.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Cons</td>
        <td>Acrylics can contain various toxins within their pigments. Acrylic paint dries very quickly and is not easily blended. We’re also not quite sure how long they will last. Unlike the other paints, they have only existed for about 50 years.</td>
        <td>While the techniques for using watercolor are fairly simple in theory, they are difficult to master. It takes a special talent and lots of practice. It is more difficult to cover a mistake. It is also a more fragile method in two ways: the paper surface and the fact that one drop of water can ruin details which took hours to create.</td>
        <td>Oil takes a very long time to dry — between 6 months to a whole year. This increases your chances of making a mess or a foreign object (dust, bugs, etc.) getting stuck in the paint. It is the most expensive on the market, and, well, it’s also pretty permanent. Oil must be removed from brushes with turpentine, and it is very easy to stain your clothing and other surfaces. Additionally,most oil paint thinners and turpentines are toxic and not particularly safe for prolonged contact.</td>
