    <p>Acrylic paint is one of the most popular types of paint for painting on canvas, and with good reason. It’s easy to work with, requires minimal supplies and dries quickly. A primed canvas provides an ideal surface for acrylic, which can be applied with a brush or palette knife. In terms of what type of acrylic paint to use, a thicker acrylic paint (sometimes called “heavy body”) will work best on canvas. Thinner acrylic paint (sometimes called “fluid acrylic”) will require a lot more paint to create an opaque layer, and can drip downward if painting on an easel.  Acrylic paint is my favourite type of paint because it is extremely versatile and easy to work with! In my opinion, it is also the most beginner-friendly so this would be a good starting point to ease into the world of painting.</p>

    <p>The techniques used for acrylic painting are varied and are specifically tied to its properties, so it’s helpful to have some background knowledge of these acrylic painting techniques before you start out. Here are some basic techniques which will hopefully give you inspiration for your own paintings!</p>

          <figcaption>
            <b>Dabbing</b><br>
           <p align="justify"> This can be achieved by using a stiff bristle brush or paper towel. Paint is applied with light and fast pressure. Dabbing adds movement to your painting and is often used to illustrate bushes or greenery. See Claude Monet for examples. </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/A palette knife.jpg"  style="width:325px;height:205px">
          <figcaption>
            <b>Palette Knife</b><br>
            <p align="justify">This technique can be used in both acrylic and oil mediums. It is achieved by loading a palette knife with paint and applying it on to the canvas with the palette knife. This will create great texture. Bob Ross makes magic through the use of this technique.</p>

        <figcaption>
          <b>Splattering</b><br>
          <p align="justify">This technique is about colour, expression and embracing the chaotic nature of life. The technique is achieved by wetting your brush in water, before dipping it into an acrylic pigment of your choice before flicking/splatter your soaked brush onto the canvas.</p>

          <figcaption>
            <b>Underpainting</b><br>
            <p align="justify">Underpainting – also referred to as “dead colouring” – is used to create a foundation for the artist to layer colour on. It is highly useful for building contrast and tonal values. Underpainting can be utilised to create tonal dominance within the painting through uniting.</p>

            <img src="images/A stippling.jpg" style="width:325px;height:205px">
            <figcaption>
              <b>Stippling</b><br>
              <p align="justify">Stippling is based on a technique initially used for printing in the early 1500s by Gulio Campagnola. Apply the head of your brush to your surface with a repetitive dabbing motion to create this effect. You can use stippling to separate colour through individual strokes of pigment. Stippling is similar to pointillism, which tends to be more precise.</p>

            <figcaption>
              <b>Pouring</b><br>
              <p align="justify">This fantastic technique is simple to execute and allows you to create some stunning works of abstract art. Choose the colours you’d like to use and individually mix them with a pouring medium. You can pour your colours individually onto the canvas or mix the colours into a container, put the canvas on top, right side facing down, flip it so that the right side of the canvas is upwards and the container of paint is on top, facing down. Slowly release the container and move the paint around the canvas.</p>
