  <p>Once you have mastered the basics of painting, it is now time to put your skills to use! Here are some fun painting activities which you can try out!</p>
  
  <i><h3 id="T5" style="font-family:Monaco">The Moving Painting</h3></i>
  <p>Painting doesn't have to just be a solo activity, it is something you can share with your friends and family as well! "The Moving Painting" aims to do just that! 
    You need at least 2 people for this activity. Essentially, every 10 minutes, you exchange paintings with your partner, no matter at what stage their painting is at. They then continue to build up on the painting their friend started with. This continues every 10 minutes until the painting is finished! 
    This game is super fun as you wouldn't know the outcome of your final painting since your friends might take a different direction from what you expected. 
    </p><br>
    <p>This game was inspired by a viral trend on the popular app "Tik Tok" where the game was termed the "Swotching Canvas Challenge". See it here:</p>
