  <p>Whether it’s traditional oil paint or water-soluble oil paint, oils are very well suited to painting on canvas. Their thick, viscous texture requires a heavy-duty painting surface to rest upon that won’t be degraded by oil, and a primed canvas provides just that. Like acrylic, oil paint can be applied either with a brush or a palette knife; it can even be applied without either, by using oil pigment bars (sort of like oil pastels). Oil paintings have a more dream-like quality to them.

<p>Unlike acrylic or watercolour paint, the pigments in oil paint often contain hazardous chemicals which can be harmful when inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Hence, it is extremely important to take these safety precautions when using oil paint.</p>

  <b>1. Keep paint off your skin</b><br>
  <p align="justify">The pigments in oil paint often contain hazardous chemicals that can be absorbed through the skin, so you should wear protective gloves and clothing. Many professional artists will reserve certain articles of clothing for when they work, and slowly develop a wardrobe for the studio. In addition, artists usually purchase latex gloves in bulk, but if you have a latex allergy, nitrile gloves can take their place. Lastly, if you ever find yourself working with loose pigments, make sure to wear a respirator. These steps may seem small or obvious, but they can prevent chronic exposure to toxic materials, and lifelong health concerns.</p>

  <b>2. Paint in a well-ventilated area</b><br> 
  <p align="justify">Use extra caution with paints classified as alkyd quick-drying colors. Unlike traditional oils, these contain a small amount of odorless solvent; you should not use these in a closed studio space unless you outfit that space with continuous airflow and exchange. When you use alkyd colors outdoors or in a well-ventilated studio, handle them in the same way as traditional oil paints.
  Many artists, of course, don’t have studios, and some admit to painting in their kitchens. This is one place where food and painting materials have too great a chance to interact. In addition, the potential for fire rises when solvents come into close contact with cooking appliances. If possible, set up a painting area in another part of the home where you can establish ventilation that constantly changes the air in the space. </p>

  <b>3. Dispose of waste paint properly</b><br>
  <p align="justify">Oil paints and solvents, and rags that have been soaked in them, constitute hazardous waste. These should not normally be disposed of in mixed municipal waste such as household and garden waste. 
  Paint should never be thrown in the trash or poured down a sink!!! Every country or state would have its own regulations on how to dispose of this waste so be sure to check what the protocol is for where you live! For Singapore, you may find detailed steps on how to responsibly dispose paint <a href="https://www.nipponpaint.com.sg/resources/disposal-storage-paint/#:~:text=When%20the%20paint%20dries%2C%20put,the%20cans%20can%20be%20recycled.">here!</a></p>
